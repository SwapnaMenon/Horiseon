HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor- First Weekly Challenge.
# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor 

Background provided:
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.


For this week's Challenge, as a Developer, my task was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. As a general rule when working with existing code, it's a good practice to always leave the code a little cleaner than how we initally found it. 

Additionally, since this is a webpage that is going be presented to a client, in this case an imaginary client, I went an extra step to improve the code ensuring long-term or future sustainability. 

Instructions provided:
Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Remember when working with a client, it is essential to read the acceptance criteria for guidance and clarity on what the client expects, especially when asked to make a judgment call, such as when an icon needs an accessible alt tag and when it is okay to leave it blank. 

To successfully complete this week's Challenge, all acceptance criteria must be fully addressed!
